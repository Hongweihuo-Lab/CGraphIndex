# CGraphIndex: Compressing and Indexing Labeled Property Graphs in High-order Entropy Space Bounds, and Applications
CGraphIndex is a high-order entropy-compressed property graph index [1]. CGraphIndex linearizes the labeled property graphs into three coordinated structures: one capturing the topological relations, the second the vertex properties, and the third the edges properties. The space usage required by CGraphIndex achieves kth-order entropy space bounds. It supports the basic operations on the graph structure and on the properties in constant time; CGraphIndex supports for the first time optimal-time BFS and the PageRank computation, and efficient algorithms for typical interactive complex queries and business intelligence queries on entropy-compressed space.
CGraphIndex is an efficient entropy-compressed indexing framework for labeled property graphs, and we expect it to open up further avenues in the theory of labeled property graph compression and indexing, as well as to practical impact on the storage and analytics of graph databases.
