# CGraphIndex
CGraphIndex is a high-order entropy-compressed property graph index [1]. The space usage required by CGraphIndex achieves kth-order entropy space bounds. It supports the fundamental operations on the graph structure and on the properties in constant time; CGraphIndex supports for the first time optimal-time BFS and the PageRank computation, and efficient algorithms for typical interactive complex queries and business intelligence queries on high-order entropy-compressed space.
CGraphIndex is an efficient entropy-compressed indexing framework for labeled property graphs, and we expect it to open up further avenues in the theory of labeled property graph compression and indexing, as well as to practical impact on the storage and analytics of graph databases.
